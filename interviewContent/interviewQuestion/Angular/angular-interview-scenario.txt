Scenario :
 
We have a parent component which holds an object with name,age and some other properties.The object is passed to child component  as an input , which is displaying only name out of the object . 
 
 1. Over a period of time, name property in object is overridden by parent , Will this change have its effect in the child component.
 2. if i dont want to trigger the change to happen in child component , even if the parent component changes the object value . How do we achieve that.
